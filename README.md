# Unexpected Type Coercion Bug in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to type coercion in a JavaScript function.  The `foo` function intends to handle `null` values gracefully, but it doesn't explicitly check for other falsy values (like `0`, `false`, `""`, etc.).  This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to fix the issue by using strict equality (`===`) and explicitly checking for the falsy values or using optional chaining or nullish coalescing operator.

This example highlights the importance of precise type checking and handling various edge cases in JavaScript.
